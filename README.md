# StoryCraftJS
A JS port of StoryCraft, as found
[here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/3mhd3s/storycraft_a_simple_story_writing_software_ive/)

**Note:** While this is entirely my code (not counting libraries, etc., which are either loaded from another site
or are in a subfolder), 
the core is not my idea, specifically features 1-9. However, with the following exceptions, features 10 and on are mine:

(none currently)

## Features
**Current Features:**

**To be added:**

1. Editing
2. Saving
3. Loading
4. Downloading
5. Uploading
6. Story Explorer
7. Notes
8. Note viewer
9. Auto-highlighting
10. Maybe some sort of "$AnchorName=Value" syntax to boost the power of notes? 

## Changelog:

### 9/28/15: Initial commit (v0.0)

- (3:30) It exists? I guess? More later.
- (4:30) Was away a bit, now html sort of has the core, and there's a bit of css.
- (5:40) Yay I added some localstorage and cookies stuff, because don't we all want simpler saving stuff?
- (note) I'll get gist saving at some point if I can figure out how to and how to make it more seamlessly work.
